    "\n",
    "**Policy Iteration** is a classic algorithm to find the OPTIMAL policy (the best action for every state). It works by alternating between two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Policy Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a policy π (a rule that says \"in state s, do action π(s)\"), calculate the **value** V(s) of each state:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V^\\pi(s) = R(s, \\pi(s)) + \\gamma \\sum_{s'} P(s'|s, \\pi(s)) V^\\pi(s')$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**In plain English**: \"The value of a state = immediate reward + discounted value of where I end up next\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We solve this by iterating until the values stop changing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Policy Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the values V(s), update the policy to be GREEDY:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\pi'(s) = \\arg\\max_a \\left[ R(s,a) + \\gamma \\sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) V(s') \\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**In plain English**: \"In each state, pick the action that gives the highest expected value\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with any policy (e.g., always cooperate)\n",
    "2. Evaluate it (calculate V)\n",
    "3. Improve it (make it greedy)\n",
    "4. If the policy didn't change, we're done! Otherwise, go to step 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is γ (gamma)?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **discount factor** γ ∈ (0,1) controls how much we care about the future:\n",
    "\n",
    "- γ = 0.1 → \"I only care about NOW\" (shortsighted)\n",
